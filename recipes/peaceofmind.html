    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Many people across cultures seek guidance int heir quest to discover inner peace.</p>
        <p>In this recipe I will provide some suggestions.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Access to nature</li>
     <li>Some kind of spiritual practice that resonates with you.</li>
     <li>Space and time to slow down.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first thing to do to encourage peace of mind is to access any nature that you can. The wilder the better. Be amongst the plants and the dirts, living things, moving water etc.</li>
        <li>I think it's important to find things that you do for your 'soul' and not for any other reason. This can be dancing, singing, yoga, meditation, prayer. It doesn't matter, just so long as you do it for <em>you</em> and it makes you feel calm, connected and peaceful.</li>
        <li>The most important step for peace of mind is to allow yourself the time and space for peace to naturally manifest. You can't force peace, peace arises.</li>
    </ol>
